## **About this project**
###### - This project is not really a project, more like a boiling pot of everything I have learned in the past week
###### - It uses google's most recent version of YouTube API but as is stands I can only access my own account info
###### - In the future I am planning to redo this project with a more interactive API
###### - It takes the api information, puts it into a DataFrame into SQLite and then prints the table that was created
